# Daily-python

Im relearning python after not having a pc for 5 months ish, tryna get used to coding agian so i decided to make 1 prog each day as well a project ill work on

Day 1- created a game to guess a number, using the random library it generates a number you have to guess. If your guess is wrong, you're told wether your guess is too high or low, a while loop repeats until you get it right
